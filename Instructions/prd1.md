## Project Requirements Document (PRD) for Next.js Application

**Project Title:** Next.js User Authentication and Dashboard Application  
**Date:** January 29, 2025  
**Prepared for:** Cursor AI Development Team

### Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a Next.js application that includes user authentication and a dashboard. The application will consist of three main pages: Login, Dashboard, and Forgot Password. The goal is to create a seamless user experience with robust authentication and activity tracking.

### Page Descriptions

#### 1. Login Page
- **Purpose:** To allow users to authenticate using their email and password.
- **Features:**
  - **Input Fields:**
    - Email: A field to enter the user's email address.
    - Password: A field to enter the user's password.
  - **Validation:**
    - Implement real-time validation on input fields to ensure correct format (e.g., valid email format).
    - Display error messages for invalid inputs or failed authentication attempts.
  - **Forgot Password Button:**
    - A button that redirects users to the Forgot Password page.
- **User Experience:**
  - Ensure a user-friendly interface with clear labels and error messages.

#### 2. Dashboard Page
- **Purpose:** To provide users with a personalized view of their account activities.
- **Features:**
  - **User Greeting:**
    - Display the logged-in user's name prominently at the top of the page.
  - **Activity Feed:**
    - A section that shows recent activities or notifications relevant to the user (e.g., recent logins, updates).
    - Activities should be displayed in chronological order with timestamps.
- **User Experience:**
  - Ensure the dashboard is visually appealing and easy to navigate, with clear sections for different types of information.

#### 3. Forgot Password Page
- **Purpose:** To allow users to reset their password if they forget it.
- **Features:**
  - **Input Field:**
    - Email: A field where users can enter their registered email address to receive a password reset link.
  - **Submission Process:**
    - On submission, validate the email format and check if it exists in the database.
    - If valid, send an email with instructions for resetting the password.
  - **Confirmation Message:**
    - Display a message indicating that an email has been sent if the email is valid or an error message if it is not.
- **User Experience:**
  - Provide clear instructions on how to reset the password and what to expect next.

### Technical Requirements
- **Framework:** Next.js 15
- **Authentication Library:** NextAuth.js for managing user sessions and authentication flows.
- **Database:** A suitable database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for storing user credentials and activity logs.
- **Environment Variables:** Secure storage of sensitive information such as API keys and database connection strings.

### Security Considerations
- Implement secure password storage using hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
- Use HTTPS for all communications between the client and server to protect user data.
- Ensure proper validation and sanitization of all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or XSS attacks.

### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to log in using my email and password so that I can access my dashboard securely.
2. As a user, I want to see my name on the dashboard so that I know I am logged in successfully.
3. As a user, I want to view my activity feed on the dashboard so that I can keep track of my account activities.
4. As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it so that I can regain access to my account.

### Conclusion
This PRD serves as a foundational document for developing a Next.js application focused on user authentication and dashboard functionality. The outlined requirements aim to create an intuitive interface while ensuring security and performance are prioritized throughout development.
